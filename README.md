- Hi, I’m @JemTB
- A full time Mathematics student
- I’m currently learning C++ and hope to learn C# in order to help with the Skyblivion project!
- I’m looking to collaborate on anything where I can be useful - I need the practice tbh
- If you need to contact me, get my attention through some repo :)
- Happy Coding!
